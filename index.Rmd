# Matrices 
## Basic Operations
Let \( m \) and \( n \) be positive integers. An \( m \times n \) matrix is a collection of \( mn \) numbers arranged in a rectangular array.

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.cap='$~$',label='fig01'}
  knitr::include_graphics('figures/ch_1/fig01.jpg') 
```
```{example}
\[A:=\begin{bmatrix}
8 & 0 & 3\\
78 & -5 & 2
\end{bmatrix}\]
$A$ is $2 \times 3$ matrix.(two rows and three columns)

```
The numbers in a matrix are the matrix entries. They may be denoted by \(a_{ij}\), where \(i\) and \(j\) are indices (integers) with \(1 < i < m\) and \(1 < j < n\). The index \(i\) represents the row index, and \(j\) represents the column index. So \(a_{ij}\) is the entry that appears in the \(i\)th row and \(j\)th column of the matrix.

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.cap='$~$',label='fig02'}
  knitr::include_graphics('figures/ch_1/fig02.png')
